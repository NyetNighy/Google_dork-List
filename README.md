# ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER & LEGAL NOTICE ⚠️

**This repository is provided strictly for EDUCATIONAL and ETHICAL SECURITY RESEARCH purposes only.**

The search queries / dorks / advanced operators shared here (originally inspired by Google Hacking Database techniques and extended to other engines) are intended to help security researchers, penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, red teamers, and website/asset owners identify publicly exposed information, misconfigurations, or unintended data exposure **only on systems they own or have explicit written permission to test**.

**You MUST obtain explicit permission** (preferably in writing, such as through a bug bounty program scope, vulnerability disclosure policy, or signed engagement letter) **before running ANY of these queries against any target, system, domain, IP range, organization, or asset that is not your own property**.

### Scope of Application
These queries may be used (with permission) on:
- General web search engines: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu, Brave Search, Ecosia, Qwant, and similar services
- Specialized device / cyberspace / IoT / vulnerability search engines: Shodan, Censys, ZoomEye, FOFA, BinaryEdge, Netlas, Onyphe, and equivalents

Different engines support different syntaxes and operators — always verify the supported syntax for each platform before use (many operators overlap but results, indexing depth, and filtering behavior vary significantly).

### Prohibited Uses
- Do **NOT** use these dorks/operators for unauthorized access, reconnaissance without consent, data theft, scraping personal or sensitive information, harassment, extortion, competitive intelligence gathering without authorization, doxxing, or any other illegal or unethical activity.
- Do **NOT** use them to violate privacy, collect personal data at scale, profile individuals, exploit vulnerabilities without following responsible disclosure practices, or chain them with automated tools for mass-scanning without permission.
- Do **NOT** attempt credential stuffing, brute-forcing, or any form of attack based on information discovered via these techniques.

Misuse of these techniques may violate laws including (but not limited to):
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the US
- Computer Misuse Act 1990 in the UK
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU
- Data Protection Act / equivalent privacy laws in other jurisdictions
- National cybersecurity / hacking / unauthorized access legislation worldwide

### No Liability
**The author(s) of this repository and any contributors are NOT responsible or liable** for any misuse, damage, legal consequences, civil claims, criminal charges, account bans, or other harm resulting from the use (or misuse) of these queries, operators, or techniques — whether on permitted or non-permitted targets.

By accessing, downloading, cloning, forking, starring, watching, or using any content from this repository, **you agree** that:
- You will use it only in an ethical, legal, and authorized manner.
- You assume full responsibility and liability for your actions.
- You will comply with all applicable local, national, and international laws.
- You will obtain proper written authorization before testing or querying any non-owned systems, domains, IPs, organizations, or assets.
- You understand that different search engines may log queries, block accounts, or report suspicious activity.

If you discover a vulnerability, exposed data, misconfiguration, or security issue using these or similar techniques, **report it responsibly** to the affected party following their coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy or bug bounty program rules — **never exploit, exfiltrate, publicize, sell, or otherwise misuse the finding without explicit permission**.

Stay ethical. Hunt bugs responsibly. Secure the web (and the things connected to it).
